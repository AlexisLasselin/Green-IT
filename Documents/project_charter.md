## ROI and Business Case Analysis

### Problematic

How can organizations effectively measure, monitor, and reduce the environmental impact of their IT infrastructures while maintaining operational efficiency and controlling costs?

### Assumptions

The following ROI analysis is based on realistic but estimated data, intended to demonstrate the potential value of the Green-IT dashboard rather than provide exact financial projections.

- Average IT infrastructure size: **10 cloud-based servers**
- Average annual energy consumption: **50,000 kWh**
- Average electricity cost: **€0.10 per kWh**
- Annual energy cost: **€5,000**
- Average carbon emission factor: **50 gCO₂ per kWh**
- Annual carbon footprint: **2.5 tons of CO₂**
- Average IT staff cost: **€20/hour**

### Business Cases

#### 1. Energy Consumption Reduction

The Green-IT monitoring dashboard enables organizations to identify inefficient resource usage, such as over-provisioned virtual machines, underutilized services, or idle workloads. By providing real-time visibility and optimization recommendations, organizations can implement targeted corrective actions.

A conservative energy reduction of **10–15%** is considered achievable.

- Estimated energy savings: **7,500 kWh per year**
- Estimated cost savings: **€750 per year**

#### 2. Carbon Emission Reduction

By optimizing energy consumption, the Green-IT dashboard directly contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with IT operations.

- Estimated CO₂ reduction: **375 kg CO₂ per year**
- Environmental impact equivalent to:

  - Approximately **2,500 km of car travel avoided**, or
  - The annual carbon absorption of **30 mature trees**

This reduction supports corporate sustainability objectives and environmental responsibility commitments.

#### 3. Operational Efficiency Gains

Without centralized monitoring, IT teams often rely on manual data collection and analysis to assess infrastructure performance and energy usage. The Green-IT dashboard automates these processes and consolidates data into a single interface.

- Estimated time saved: **2 hours per week**
- Annual time savings: **~100 hours**
- Estimated productivity gain: **€2,000 per year**

#### 4. Regulatory Compliance and Sustainability Reporting

Increasing environmental regulations and corporate social responsibility (CSR) requirements demand accurate reporting of energy consumption and carbon emissions. The Green-IT dashboard provides structured and exportable sustainability reports, reducing compliance risks and preparation effort.

Although difficult to quantify financially, this benefit contributes to:

- Reduced regulatory risk
- Improved audit readiness
- Enhanced corporate sustainability image

### ROI Summary

| Category                           | Estimated Annual Value |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Energy cost savings                | €750                   |
| Operational efficiency gains       | €2,000                 |
| **Total estimated annual benefit** | **€2,750**             |

### Non-Financial ROI

In addition to measurable financial benefits, the Green-IT dashboard provides several qualitative advantages:

- Improved environmental awareness across IT teams
- Better-informed infrastructure decision-making
- Enhanced corporate sustainability reputation
- Educational value for IT and sustainability best practices
- Promotion of a culture of continuous improvement in environmental performance
